# ShopManagement-SourCecodes

A complete Java based back-end and front-end (GUI) application that helps the shop owners to keep track of all the products, their selling price, cost price, stock as well as daily sales record of each product. In addition to that user also gets a complete analysis of shop that includes profit-loss analysis on yearly as wells as monthly basis and sale-restock analysis that too for each month as well as for entire year. There are 6 main windows, each of them provides different facilities as well as infoemation to the user.

1] Account Window : Here, the user can check the account balance of his shop's account. the user can also deposit or withdraw amount to his account. Any sale or re-stock activity performed, updates the amount in the account instantly.

2] Products Window : This window contains the list of the products that the shop sells. The user can add new products, remove existing products and even update the selling price and cost price of any product.

3] Daily Sales Window : The list of the products purchased by the customer is generated here, which shows the total products purchased by the customer, their cost and total billling amount of the customer. The customer's bill is also generated once the purchase is confirmed which can be viewed in the view bill window.

4] Re-Stock Window : Here, the total units of each product availabe in the stock are represented using a pie chart. User can even re-stock the products form this window. Either user can manually re-stock the products, or can use the suggeseted re-stock option which suggests the quantities of products to be re-stocked based on users budget and previous month's sales.

5] Profit-Loss Analysis : This window indicated the profit or loss faced by the shop in graphical representation. It has two options, monthly profit-loss and yearly profit-loss.

All the data is stored on the user's computer and care has been taken that it doesn't overload the user's computer.
